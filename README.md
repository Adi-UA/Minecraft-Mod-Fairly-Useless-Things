# Fairly Useless Things
Like the title says, this mod is fairly useless. It is WIP and has no overarching goal, but I have a few ideas. Currently, 
the mod only has a few things, all of which are also WIP and do nothing special.

### Usage
Like the description says, this mod is still WIP, but you can use the file [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZumuNg5wqIuycxX3I7rGqBHPtsC47OrI) if you're curious. As long as you adhere to the license, you can play around with the code for this whole project.

### Mod Info?
New sections containing more detailed mod info will be added. For now, look at the pull commit history.
