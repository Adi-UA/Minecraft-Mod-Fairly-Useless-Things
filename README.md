# Fairly Useless Things
Like the title says, this mod is fairly useless. It is WIP and has no overarching goal, but I have a few ideas. Currently, 
the mod has only  two items and two blocks, both of which are also WIP and do nothing special. So right now, this mod is fairly useless.

### Usage
Like the description says, this mod is still WIP, but you can use the file in the  `Exported Mod Jar` directory if you're curious. As long as you adhere to the license, you can play around with the code for this whole project.


### Blocks
The Hallow

The Curse

### Items
Hallow Ingot

Curse Ingot

### Note
This mod may undergo massive refactoring in the future :)
