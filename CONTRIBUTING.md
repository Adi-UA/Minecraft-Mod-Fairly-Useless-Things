# Contributing
For everyone who is (or will soon be) a collaborator the guidelines are simple; create a new branch to make your changes,
and then submit those changes through a pull request to the master branch.

Issues and TODOs aren't being tracked on GitHub for the moment.

Note: Merging into master may be restricted to certain collaborators only.
